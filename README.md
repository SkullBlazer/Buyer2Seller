# Buyer2Seller

Buyer2Seller connects the seller directly through the buyer, instead of passing the goods and money through a middleman.

#### I think this could be useful when buyers are looking to buy goods on a regular (weekly, monthly) basis, or if they want to buy goods in bulk.

The user can view and browse through our categories of products.

But if they wish to buy something, they have to either register for an account or login to an already existing account.

After that, they can place order for any amount of products they want, which will be emailed to the respective seller.

The buyer will then be provided with the details of the seller, where they can contact the seller and negotiate for a price if they wish, or confirm some details.

Since our website does not guarantee the trust of any buyer or seller, the buyer will have to pay on delivery.
